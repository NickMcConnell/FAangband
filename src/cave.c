/**
 * A simple, fast, integer-based line-of-sight algorithm.  By Joseph Hall,
 * 4116 Brewster Drive, Raleigh NC 27606.  Email to jnh@ecemwl.ncsu.edu.
 *
 * This function returns TRUE if a "line of sight" can be traced from the
 * center of the grid (x1,y1) to the center of the grid (x2,y2), with all
 * of the grids along this path (except for the endpoints) being non-wall
 * grids, that are also not trees or rubble.  Actually, the "chess knight 
 * move" situation is handled by some special case code which allows the 
 * grid diagonally next to the player to be obstructed, because this 
 * yields better gameplay semantics.  This algorithm is totally reflexive, 
 * except for "knight move" situations.
 *
 * Because this function uses (short) ints for all calculations, overflow
 * may occur if dx and dy exceed 90.
 *
 * Once all the degenerate cases are eliminated, we determine the "slope"
 * ("m"), and we use special "fixed point" mathematics in which we use a
 * special "fractional component" for one of the two location components
 * ("qy" or "qx"), which, along with the slope itself, are "scaled" by a
 * scale factor equal to "abs(dy*dx*2)" to keep the math simple.  Then we
 * simply travel from start to finish along the longer axis, starting at
 * the border between the first and second tiles (where the y offset is
 * thus half the slope), using slope and the fractional component to see
 * when motion along the shorter axis is necessary.  Since we assume that
 * vision is not blocked by "brushing" the corner of any grid, we must do
 * some special checks to avoid testing grids which are "brushed" but not
 * actually "entered".
 *
 * Angband three different "line of sight" type concepts, including this
 * function (which is used almost nowhere), the "project()" method (which
 * is used for determining the paths of projectables and spells and such),
 * and the "update_view()" concept (which is used to determine which grids
 * are "viewable" by the player, which is used for many things, such as
 * determining which grids are illuminated by the player's torch, and which
 * grids and monsters can be "seen" by the player, etc).

/*
 * This function takes a grid location (x, y) and extracts information the
 * player is allowed to know about it, filling in the grid_data structure
 * passed in 'g'.
 *
 * The information filled in is as follows:
 *  - g->f_idx is filled in with the terrain's feature type, or FEAT_NONE
 *    if the player doesn't know anything about the grid.  The function
 *    makes use of the "mimic" field in terrain in order to allow one
 *    feature to look like another (hiding secret doors, invisible traps,
 *    etc).  This will return the terrain type the player "Knows" about,
 *    not necessarily the real terrain.
 *  - g->m_idx is set to the monster index, or 0 if there is none (or the
 *    player doesn't know it).
 *  - g->first_k_idx is set to the index of the first object in a grid
 *    that the player knows (and cares, as per OPT(hide_squelchable)) about,
 *    or zero for no object in the grid.
 *  - g->muliple_objects is TRUE if there is more than one object in the
 *    grid that the player knows and cares about (to facilitate any special
 *    floor stack symbol that might be used).
 *  - g->in_view is TRUE if the player can currently see the grid - this can
 *    be used to indicate field-of-view, such as through the OPT(view_bright_light)
 *    option.
 *  - g->lighting is set to indicate the lighting level for the grid:
 *    LIGHT_DARK for unlit grids, LIGHT_TORCH for those lit by the player's
 *    light source, and LIGHT_GLOW for inherently light grids (lit rooms, etc).
 *    Note that lighting is always LIGHT_GLOW for known "interesting" grids
 *    like walls.
 *  - g->is_player is TRUE if the player is on the given grid.
 *  - g->hallucinate is TRUE if the player is hallucinating something "strange"
 *    for this grid - this should pick a random monster to show if the m_idx
 *    is non-zero, and a random object if first_k_idx is non-zero.
 *       
 * NOTES:
 * This is called pretty frequently, whenever a grid on the map display
 * needs updating, so don't overcomplicate it.
 *
 * Terrain is remembered separately from objects and monsters, so can be
 * shown even when the player can't "see" it.  This leads to things like
 * doors out of the player's view still change from closed to open and so on.
 *
 * TODO:
 * Hallucination is currently disabled (it was a display-level hack before,
 * and we need it to be a knowledge-level hack).  The idea is that objects
 * may turn into different objects, monsters into different monsters, and
 * terrain may be objects, monsters, or stay the same.

/**
 * Some comments on the dungeon related data structures and functions...
 *
 * Angband is primarily a dungeon exploration game, and it should come as
 * no surprise that the internal representation of the dungeon has evolved
 * over time in much the same way as the game itself, to provide semantic
 * changes to the game itself, to make the code simpler to understand, and
 * to make the executable itself faster or more efficient in various ways.
 *
 * There are a variety of dungeon related data structures, and associated
 * functions, which store information about the dungeon, and provide methods
 * by which this information can be accessed or modified.
 *
 * Some of this information applies to the dungeon as a whole, such as the
 * list of unique monsters which are still alive.  Some of this information
 * only applies to the current dungeon level, such as the current depth, or
 * the list of monsters currently inhabiting the level.   And some of the
 * information only applies to a single grid of the current dungeon level,
 * such as whether the grid is illuminated, or whether the grid contains a
 * monster, or whether the grid can be seen by the player.  If Angband was
 * to be turned into a multi-player game, some of the information currently
 * associated with the dungeon should really be associated with the player,
 * such as whether a given grid is viewable by a given player.
 *
 * One of the major bottlenecks in ancient versions of Angband was in the
 * calculation of "line of sight" from the player to various grids, such
 * as those containing monsters, using the relatively expensive "los()"
 * function.  This was such a nasty bottleneck that a lot of silly things
 * were done to reduce the dependancy on "line of sight", for example, you
 * could not "see" any grids in a lit room until you actually entered the
 * room, at which point every grid in the room became "illuminated" and
 * all of the grids in the room were "memorized" forever.  Other major
 * bottlenecks involved the determination of whether a grid was lit by the
 * player's torch, and whether a grid blocked the player's line of sight.
 * These bottlenecks led to the development of special new functions to
 * optimize issues involved with "line of sight" and "torch lit grids".
 * These optimizations led to entirely new additions to the game, such as
 * the ability to display the player's entire field of view using different
 * colors than were used for the "memorized" portions of the dungeon, and
 * the ability to memorize dark floor grids, but to indicate by the way in
 * which they are displayed that they are not actually illuminated.  And
 * of course many of them simply made the game itself faster or more fun.
 * Also, over time, the definition of "line of sight" has been relaxed to
 * allow the player to see a wider "field of view", which is slightly more
 * realistic, and only slightly more expensive to maintain.
 *
 * Currently, a lot of the information about the dungeon is stored in ways
 * that make it very efficient to access or modify the information, while
 * still attempting to be relatively conservative about memory usage, even
 * if this means that some information is stored in multiple places, or in
 * ways which require the use of special code idioms.  For example, each
 * monster record in the monster array contains the location of the monster,
 * and each cave grid has an index into the monster array, or a zero if no
 * monster is in the grid.  This allows the monster code to efficiently see
 * where the monster is located, while allowing the dungeon code to quickly
 * determine not only if a monster is present in a given grid, but also to
 * find out which monster.  The extra space used to store the information
 * twice is inconsequential compared to the speed increase.
 *
 * Some of the information about the dungeon is used by functions which can
 * constitute the "critical efficiency path" of the game itself, and so the
 * way in which they are stored and accessed has been optimized in order to
 * optimize the game itself.  For example, the "update_view()" function was
 * originally created to speed up the game itself (when the player was not
 * running), but then it took on extra responsibility as the provider of the
 * new "special effects lighting code", and became one of the most important
 * bottlenecks when the player was running.  So many rounds of optimization
 * were performed on both the function itself, and the data structures which
 * it uses, resulting eventually in a function which not only made the game
 * faster than before, but which was responsible for even more calculations
 * (including the determination of which grids are "viewable" by the player,
 * which grids are illuminated by the player's torch, and which grids can be
 * "seen" in some way by the player), as well as for providing the guts of
 * the special effects lighting code, and for the efficient redisplay of any
 * grids whose visual representation may have changed.
 *
 * Several pieces of information about each cave grid are stored in various
 * two dimensional arrays, with one unit of information for each grid in the
 * dungeon.  Some of these arrays have been intentionally expanded by a small
 * factor to make the two dimensional array accesses faster by allowing the
 * use of shifting instead of multiplication.
 *
 * Several pieces of information about each cave grid are stored in the
 * "cave_info" array, which is a special two dimensional array of bytes,
 * one for each cave grid, each containing eight separate "flags" which
 * describe some property of the cave grid.  These flags can be checked and
 * modified extremely quickly, especially when special idioms are used to
 * force the compiler to keep a local register pointing to the base of the
 * array.  Special location offset macros can be used to minimize the number
 * of computations which must be performed at runtime.  Note that using a
 * byte for each flag set may be slightly more efficient than using a larger
 * unit, so if another flag (or two) is needed later, and it must be fast,
 * then the two existing flags which do not have to be fast should be moved
 * out into some other data structure and the new flags should take their
 * place.  This may require a few minor changes in the savefile code.
 *
 * The "CAVE_ROOM" flag is saved in the savefile and is used to determine
 * which grids are part of "rooms", and thus which grids are affected by
 * "illumination" spells.  This flag does not have to be very fast.
 *
 * The "CAVE_ICKY" flag is saved in the savefile and is used to determine
 * which grids are part of "vaults", and thus which grids cannot serve as
 * the destinations of player teleportation.  This flag does not have to
 * be very fast.
 *
 * The "CAVE_MARK" flag is saved in the savefile and is used to determine
 * which grids have been "memorized" by the player.  This flag is used by
 * the "map_info()" function to determine if a grid should be displayed.
 * This flag is used in a few other places to determine if the player can
 * "know" about a given grid.  This flag must be very fast. 
 *
 * The "CAVE_GLOW" flag is saved in the savefile and is used to determine
 * which grids are "permanently illuminated".  This flag is used by the
 * "update_view()" function to help determine which viewable flags may
 * be "seen" by the player.  This flag is used by the "map_info" function
 * to determine if a grid is only lit by the player's torch.  This flag
 * has special semantics for wall grids (see "update_view()").  This flag
 * must be very fast.
 *
 * The "CAVE_WALL" flag is used to determine which grids block the player's
 * line of sight.  This flag is used by the "update_view()" function to
 * determine which grids block line of sight, and to help determine which
 * grids can be "seen" by the player.  This flag must be very fast.
 *
 * The "CAVE_VIEW" flag is used to determine which grids are currently in
 * line of sight of the player.   This flag is set by (and used by) the
 * "update_view()" function.  This flag is used by any code which needs to
 * know if the player can "view" a given grid.  This flag is used by the
 * "map_info()" function for some optional special lighting effects.  The
 * "player_has_los_bold()" macro wraps an abstraction around this flag, but
 * certain code idioms are much more efficient.   This flag is used to check
 * if a modification to a terrain feature might affect the player's field of
 * view.  This flag is used to see if certain monsters are "visible" to the
 * player.  This flag is used to allow any monster in the player's field of
 * view to "sense" the presence of the player.  This flag must be very fast.
 *
 * The "CAVE_SEEN" flag is used to determine which grids are currently in
 * line of sight of the player and also illuminated in some way.  This flag
 * is set by the "update_view()" function, using computations based on the
 * "CAVE_VIEW" and "CAVE_WALL" and "CAVE_GLOW" flags of various grids.  This
 * flag is used by any code which needs to know if the player can "see" a
 * given grid.  This flag is used by the "map_info()" function both to see
 * if a given "boring" grid can be seen by the player, and for some optional
 * special lighting effects.  The "player_can_see_bold()" macro wraps an
 * abstraction around this flag, but certain code idioms are much more
 * efficient.  This flag is used to see if certain monsters are "visible" to
 * the player.  This flag is never set for a grid unless "CAVE_VIEW" is also
 * set for the grid.  Whenever the "CAVE_WALL" or "CAVE_GLOW" flag changes
 * for a grid which has the "CAVE_VIEW" flag set, the "CAVE_SEEN" flag must
 * be recalculated.  The simplest way to do this is to call "forget_view()"
 * and "update_view()" whenever the "CAVE_WALL" or "CAVE_GLOW" flags change
 * for a grid which has "CAVE_VIEW" set.  This flag must be very fast.
 *
 * The "CAVE_TEMP" flag is used for a variety of temporary purposes.  This
 * flag is used to determine if the "CAVE_SEEN" flag for a grid has changed
 * during the "update_view()" function.   This flag is used to "spread" light
 * or darkness through a room.  This flag is used by the "monster flow code".
 * This flag must always be cleared by any code which sets it, often, this
 * can be optimized by the use of the special "temp_g", "temp_y", "temp_x"
 * arrays (and the special "temp_n" global).  This flag must be very fast.
 *
 * Note that the "CAVE_MARK" flag is used for many reasons, some of which
 * are strictly for optimization purposes.  The "CAVE_MARK" flag means that
 * even if the player cannot "see" the grid, he "knows" about the terrain in
 * that grid.  This is used to "memorize" grids when they are first "seen" by
 * the player, and to allow certain grids to be "detected" by certain magic.
 * Note that most grids are always memorized when they are first "seen", but
 * "boring" grids (floor grids) are only memorized if the "view_torch_grids"
 * option is set, or if the "view_perma_grids" option is set, and the grid
 * in question has the "CAVE_GLOW" flag set.
 *
 * Objects are "memorized" in a different way, using a special "marked" flag
 * on the object itself, which is set when an object is observed or detected.
 * This allows objects to be "memorized" independant of the terrain features.
 *
 * The "update_view()" function is an extremely important function.  It is
 * called only when the player moves, significant terrain changes, or the
 * player's blindness or torch radius changes.  Note that when the player
 * is resting, or performing any repeated actions (like digging, disarming,
 * farming, etc), there is no need to call the "update_view()" function, so
 * even if it was not very efficient, this would really only matter when the
 * player was "running" through the dungeon.  It sets the "CAVE_VIEW" flag
 * on every cave grid in the player's field of view, and maintains an array
 * of all such grids in the global "view_g" array.  It also checks the torch
 * radius of the player, and sets the "CAVE_SEEN" flag for every grid which
 * is in the "field of view" of the player and which is also "illuminated",
 * either by the players torch (if any) or by any permanent light source.
 * It could use and help maintain information about multiple light sources,
 * which would be helpful in a multi-player version of Angband.
 *
 * The "update_view()" function maintains the special "view_g" array, which
 * contains exactly those grids which have the "CAVE_VIEW" flag set.  This
 * array is used by "update_view()" to (only) memorize grids which become
 * newly "seen", and to (only) redraw grids whose "seen" value changes, which
 * allows the use of some interesting (and very efficient) "special lighting
 * effects".  In addition, this array could be used elsewhere to quickly scan
 * through all the grids which are in the player's field of view.
 *
 * Note that the "update_view()" function allows, among other things, a room
 * to be "partially" seen as the player approaches it, with a growing cone
 * of floor appearing as the player gets closer to the door.  Also, by not
 * turning on the "memorize perma-lit grids" option, the player will only
 * "see" those floor grids which are actually in line of sight.   And best
 * of all, you can now activate the special lighting effects to indicate
 * which grids are actually in the player's field of view by using dimmer
 * colors for grids which are not in the player's field of view, and/or to
 * indicate which grids are illuminated only by the player's torch by using
 * the color yellow for those grids.
 *
 * The old "update_view()" algorithm uses the special "CAVE_EASY" flag as a
 * temporary internal flag to mark those grids which are not only in view,
 * but which are also "easily" in line of sight of the player.  This flag
 * is actually just the "CAVE_SEEN" flag, and the "update_view()" function
 * makes sure to clear it for all old "CAVE_SEEN" grids, and then use it in
 * the algorithm as "CAVE_EASY", and then clear it for all "CAVE_EASY" grids,
 * and then reset it as appropriate for all new "CAVE_SEEN" grids.  This is
 * kind of messy, but it works.   The old algorithm may disappear eventually.
 *
 * The new "update_view()" algorithm uses a faster and more mathematically
 * correct algorithm, assisted by a large machine generated static array, to
 * determine the "CAVE_VIEW" and "CAVE_SEEN" flags simultaneously.  See below.
 *
 * It seems as though slight modifications to the "update_view()" functions
 * would allow us to determine "reverse" line-of-sight as well as "normal"
 * line-of-sight", which would allow monsters to have a more "correct" way
 * to determine if they can "see" the player, since right now, they "cheat"
 * somewhat and assume that if the player has "line of sight" to them, then
 * they can "pretend" that they have "line of sight" to the player.  But if
 * such a change was attempted, the monsters would actually start to exhibit
 * some undesirable behavior, such as "freezing" near the entrances to long
 * hallways containing the player, and code would have to be added to make
 * the monsters move around even if the player was not detectable, and to
 * "remember" where the player was last seen, to avoid looking stupid.
 *
 * Note that the "CAVE_GLOW" flag means that a grid is permanently lit in
 * some way.  However, for the player to "see" the grid, as determined by
 * the "CAVE_SEEN" flag, the player must not be blind, the grid must have
 * the "CAVE_VIEW" flag set, and if the grid is a "wall" grid, and it is
 * not lit by the player's torch, then it must touch a grid which does not
 * have the "CAVE_WALL" flag set, but which does have both the "CAVE_GLOW"
 * and "CAVE_VIEW" flags set.  This last part about wall grids is induced
 * by the semantics of "CAVE_GLOW" as applied to wall grids, and checking
 * the technical requirements can be very expensive, especially since the
 * grid may be touching some "illegal" grids.  Luckily, it is more or less
 * correct to restrict the "touching" grids from the eight "possible" grids
 * to the (at most) three grids which are touching the grid, and which are
 * closer to the player than the grid itself, which eliminates more than
 * half of the work, including all of the potentially "illegal" grids, if
 * at most one of the three grids is a "diagonal" grid.   In addition, in
 * almost every situation, it is possible to ignore the "CAVE_VIEW" flag
 * on these three "touching" grids, for a variety of technical reasons.
 * Finally, note that in most situations, it is only necessary to check
 * a single "touching" grid, in fact, the grid which is strictly closest
 * to the player of all the touching grids, and in fact, it is normally
 * only necessary to check the "CAVE_GLOW" flag of that grid, again, for
 * various technical reasons.  However, one of the situations which does
 * not work with this last reduction is the very common one in which the
 * player approaches an illuminated room from a dark hallway, in which the
 * two wall grids which form the "entrance" to the room would not be marked
 * as "CAVE_SEEN", since of the three "touching" grids nearer to the player
 * than each wall grid, only the farthest of these grids is itself marked
 * "CAVE_GLOW". 
 *
 *
 * Here are some pictures of the legal "light source" radius values, in
 * which the numbers indicate the "order" in which the grids could have
 * been calculated, if desired.   Note that the code will work with larger
 * radiuses, though currently yields such a radius, and the game would
 * become slower in some situations if it did.

 * Normally, vision along the major axes is more likely than vision

 * We use the "temp_g" array (and the "CAVE_TEMP" flag) to keep track of
 * which grids were previously marked "CAVE_SEEN", since only those grids
 * whose "CAVE_SEEN" value changes during this routine must be redrawn.
 *
 * This function is now responsible for maintaining the "CAVE_SEEN"
 * flags as well as the "CAVE_VIEW" flags, which is good, because
 * the only grids which normally need to be memorized and/or redrawn
 * are the ones whose "CAVE_SEEN" flag changes during this routine.
 *
 * Basically, this function divides the "octagon of view" into octants of
 * grids (where grids on the main axes and diagonal axes are "shared" by
 * two octants), and processes each octant one at a time, processing each
 * octant one grid at a time, processing only those grids which "might" be
 * viewable, and setting the "CAVE_VIEW" flag for each grid for which there
 * is an (unobstructed) line of sight from the center of the player grid to
 * any internal point in the grid (and collecting these "CAVE_VIEW" grids
 * into the "view_g" array), and setting the "CAVE_SEEN" flag for the grid
 * if, in addition, the grid is "illuminated" in some way.
 *
 * This function relies on a theorem (suggested and proven by Mat Hostetter)
 * which states that in each octant of a field of view, a given grid will
 * be "intersected" by one or more unobstructed "lines of sight" from the
 * center of the player grid if and only if it is "intersected" by at least
 * one such unobstructed "line of sight" which passes directly through some
 * corner of some grid in the octant which is not shared by any other octant.
 * The proof is based on the fact that there are at least three significant
 * lines of sight involving any non-shared grid in any octant, one which
 * intersects the grid and passes though the corner of the grid closest to
 * the player, and two which "brush" the grid, passing through the "outer"
 * corners of the grid, and that any line of sight which intersects a grid
 * without passing through the corner of a grid in the octant can be "slid"
 * slowly towards the corner of the grid closest to the player, until it
 * either reaches it or until it brushes the corner of another grid which
 * is closer to the player, and in either case, the existanc of a suitable
 * line of sight is thus demonstrated.
 *
 * It turns out that in each octant of the radius 20 "octagon of view",
 * there are 161 grids (with 128 not shared by any other octant), and there
 * are exactly 126 distinct "lines of sight" passing from the center of the
 * player grid through any corner of any non-shared grid in the octant.   To
 * determine if a grid is "viewable" by the player, therefore, you need to
 * simply show that one of these 126 lines of sight intersects the grid but
 * does not intersect any wall grid closer to the player.  So we simply use
 * a bit vector with 126 bits to represent the set of interesting lines of
 * sight which have not yet been obstructed by wall grids, and then we scan
 * all the grids in the octant, moving outwards from the player grid.  For
 * each grid, if any of the lines of sight which intersect that grid have not
 * yet been obstructed, then the grid is viewable.  Furthermore, if the grid
 * is a wall grid, then all of the lines of sight which intersect the grid
 * should be marked as obstructed for future reference.   Also, we only need
 * to check those grids for whom at least one of the "parents" was a viewable
 * non-wall grid, where the parents include the two grids touching the grid
 * but closer to the player grid (one adjacent, and one diagonal).  For the
 * bit vector, we simply use 4 32-bit integers.   All of the static values
 * which are needed by this function are stored in the large "vinfo" array
 * (above), which is machine generated by another program.  XXX XXX XXX
 *
 * Hack -- The queue must be able to hold more than VINFO_MAX_GRIDS grids
 * because the grids at the edge of the field of view use "grid zero" as
 * their children, and the queue must be able to hold several of these
 * special grids.  Because the actual number of required grids is bizarre,
 * we simply allocate twice as many as we would normally need.  XXX XXX XXX

/**
 * Determine the path taken by a projection.
 *
 * The projection will always start from the grid (y1,x1), and will travel
 * towards the grid (y2,x2), touching one grid per unit of distance along
 * the major axis, and stopping when it enters the destination grid or a
 * wall grid, or has travelled the maximum legal distance of "range".
 *
 * Note that "distance" in this function (as in the update_view() code)
 * is defined as "MAX(dy,dx) + MIN(dy,dx)/2", which means that the player
 * actually has an "octagon of projection" not a "circle of projection".
 *
 * The path grids are saved into the grid array pointed to by "gp", and
 * there should be room for at least "range" grids in "gp".  Note that
 * due to the way in which distance is calculated, this function normally
 * uses fewer than "range" grids for the projection path, so the result
 * of this function should never be compared directly to "range".  Note
 * that the initial grid (y1,x1) is never saved into the grid array, not
 * even if the initial grid is also the final grid.  XXX XXX XXX
 *
 * The "flg" flags can be used to modify the behavior of this function.
 *
 * In particular, the "PROJECT_STOP" and "PROJECT_THRU" flags have the same
 * semantics as they do for the "project" function, namely, that the path
 * will stop as soon as it hits a monster, or that the path will continue
 * through the destination grid, respectively.
 *
 * The "PROJECT_JUMP" flag, which for the project() function means to
 * start at a special grid (which makes no sense in this function), means
 * that the path should be "angled" slightly if needed to avoid any wall
 * grids, allowing the player to "target" any grid which is in "view".
 * This flag is non-trivial and has not yet been implemented, but could
 * perhaps make use of the "vinfo" array (above).  XXX XXX XXX
 *
 * This function returns the number of grids (if any) in the path.  This
 * function will return zero if and only if (y1,x1) and (y2,x2) are equal.
 *
 * This algorithm is similar to, but slightly different from, the one used
 * by update_view_los(), and very different from the one used by los().
