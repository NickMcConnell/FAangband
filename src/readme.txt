	FAangband Source Material

Below is a description of the uses to which the material in this distribution
can be put (basically anything, with attribution, and noting the licence).  
Obviously, contact me rather than Leon or Bahman, and I will be happy to help 
you.

=====================================================================
	Oangband 0.5.0 Source Material - the Readme


Welcome, fellow programmer.

	This file is for those who have, are, or might in the future
use Oangband material.  If you are planning to release an Oangband
port, please do not include this file with the distribution.  It is
addressed to you as coder, and the general public would not have much
need for it.



=== Using Oangband files and code ===

	Oangband code, documentation, supporting files, and anything
else I include with this variant may all be used as freely as you
would material from any other variant or Standard Angband itself.

	Any and all material created or edited by Leon Marrick may be
used for any unprofit, Angband-related purpose; in whole, in part, or
rearranged in any way imaginable, with or without explicit permission,
as long as both my name and all those I list as sources, contributers,
or partners are included with all such material and in a general
attribution file (if you happen to have one).


Using Oangband material within an existing project:

	Oangband source code, or most information in the *.info.txt
files, generally needs nothing more than a few "-LM-", "-BR-", or
"Oangband"s, but written material, including descriptions in
*_info.txt files, requires a full name, or list of names if I cite
any, on each file.

	It is generally not a good idea to take more than half of
Oangband's additions to any one *info.txt file.  This may sound kind
of Prussian, but this mistake has been made more than once.


Creating a project based primarily on Oangband, as Oangband is on Angband:

	If you are using Oangband as the foundation for your own
variant, nothing Oangband-related created or edited by me needs to be
explicitly cited, but all my citations of other peoples' ideas and
works still need to be retained.  Most of the "-LM-"s or "-BR-"s in
the source code can (and should) disappear.  Just insert a monogram
somewhere in the heading of functions created or importantly modified
by me, similar to the "-RAK-"s, "-BEN-"s, etc. you will find floating
around.


=== Mutual Assistance ===

	I will be happy (assuming Real Life hasn't eaten me :-]) to
act as a consultant to you about using Oangband stuff.  Not all my
code is entirely safe; I can often point out areas you should be -
especially! - wary of.  Virtually all my changes rely on a much larger
framework of game rebalances and supporting code hidden elsewhere;
I'll answer any questions you might have.  This applies especially to
those using Oangband as a base for their own creations.

	I would be deeply obliged to you if you point out errors, or
report on places where I need to improve, especially in material you
use.

Yours,
Bahman Rabii & Leon Marrick
