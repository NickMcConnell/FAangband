====================
Creating a Character
====================

FAangband is a roleplaying game, in which you, the player, control a
character in the world of FAangband. Perhaps the most important thing you
control is the birth of your character, in which you choose or allow to be
chosen various attributes that will affect the future life of your
character.

At the character creation screen you will be prompted to select the
race and class of your character. You also have the option to change the
'birth options' at this time. These need to be set at the character
creation menu and cannot be altered later in the game. They are discussed
with the rest of the options in the "options" help file.

Character Characteristics
=========================

Each character has two primary attributes: race and class. These
are chosen at the beginning and which will stay fixed for the entire life
of that character. The race and class have many effects which are discussed
in detail below.

Each character has a few secondary attributes: height, weight, and
background history. These are randomly determined according to the race of
the character, and are only used to provide flavour to the character to
assist in role playing.  There is an opportunity to edit background history
during character birth.

Each character also has five primary "stats": strength, intelligence,
wisdom, dexterity, and constitution; they modify the abilities
of the character in a variety of ways. Every stat has a numerical value,
ranging from a minimum of 3, up to a normal maximum of 18, and even higher,
into the "percentile" range, represented as '18/01' through '18/100':
this is the maximum that can be achieved intrinsically, for any given stat.
These stats can be modified further by equipment, race and class bonuses up
to a maximum of '18/220'.

Each character also has several primary "skills": disarming, magic devices,
saving throws, stealth, searching ability, fighting skill, shooting skill, 
and digging skill, which are derived from the character's race,
class, level, stats, and current equipment. These skills have rather 
obvious effects, but will be described more completely below.

Each character may have one or more "racially intrinsic skills", based on
the race of the character. These may include special resistances, or
abilities such as infravision.

.. index::
   single: experience points; description
   see: EXP; experience points

Each character has a number of "experience points", which increases as the
character defeats monsters and attempts new spells and uses new items.
Characters also have a level, which is based on experience. As the experience
rises, so does the level, and as the level rises, certain other abilities
and characteristics rise as well.

In wilderness modes, different races start in different towns spread out
across the world. Those that start in more dangerous areas will already have
enough experience to be at a level above 1.  In dungeon modes, all characters
start at 0 experience and at the first level.

.. index::
   single: gold; description
   see: AU; gold

Each character has some gold, which can be used to buy items from the shops
in their hometown. A character starts with a fixed amount of gold and some
items. If you play with the starting kit option on (it is on by default), your
character will have a few more useful items but less gold. A character can
find more gold by taking it from dead monsters, finding it on the floors of
the dungeon or by digging out veins of treasure from the walls of the dungeon.
If you play with the no selling option off (it is on by default), you can
sell items to the shopkeepers for gold. A shopkeeper will usually only buy
certain classes of items, refuse to buy an item the shopkeeper believes is
worthless and offer less gold for an item than she or he would sell it for.
A shopkeeper also has an upper limit for the amount of gold offered for an
item. The more generous shop-keepers will buy an item for up to 30,000 gold
pieces, but some of the stingy ones will only pay 5,000.

.. index::
   single: armour class; description
   see: AC; armour class

Each character has an "armour class", abbreviated to AC, representing how
well the character can avoid damage. The armour class is affected by
dexterity and equipment, so the concept includes both avoiding blows and
being able to take blows without being hurt. Armour class on equipment is
always denoted in square brackets, usually as a figure of '[X,+Y]' where
X is the intrinsic AC of the armour in question, and Y is the magical bonus
to armour class provided by that item.

.. index::
   single: hit points; description
   see: HP; hit points
   single: hit dice; description
   see: HD; hit dice

Each character has "hit points", or hp, representing how much damage the
character can sustain before they die. How many hit points a character has
is determined by race, class, level and constitution, as follows: each race
has a basic "hit dice" number - for instance, a Dwarf's basic hit die is
11, while a hobbit's is 7. This is modified by class: for instance, a
warrior gets a +9 bonus to the hit die, while a mage gets no bonus and a
priest +2, so a dwarven warrior's total hit die will be (11+9)=20 - meaning
that they get between 1 and 20 hit points per level. If they were a priest,
his hit dice would be (11+2)=13, and get between 1 and 13 hit points per
level. The hobbit mage would get only 1-7 hps per level. (All characters
get the maximum at first level: thereafter it is a random roll of 1dX where
X is the hit die number, when the character goes up in level.) This is
further modified by constitution - a character with high constitution will
get a flat bonus of a certain number of hit points per level (recalculated
right back to level 1: if you gain an extra hit point per level, and you
are 42nd level, you will suddenly be 42 hit points better off.)

.. index::
   single: spell points; description
   see: mana; spell points

Each character has spell points, or mana, which limits how many spells (or
prayers) a character can cast (or pray). The maximum number of spell points
is derived from your class, level, and intelligence (for spells) or wisdom
(for prayers), and you can never have more spell points than the maximum.
Spell points may be regained by resting, or by magical means. Warriors
never have any spell points. If a character gains enough wisdom or
intelligence to get more spell points, the result is calculated right back
to first level, just as with constitution and hit points.

Lastly, each character has a base speed. Speed determines the amount of
"energy" your character acquires in the game, and therefore how often you
can take actions which use up energy (like moving or attacking). All
beginning characters move at normal speed and the only way to increase
speed is by magical means and equipment bonuses. Characters who are
carrying too much weight will move more slowly. Extra speed is one of the
most important boons in the game and therefore one of the rarest and most
sought after.

Races
=====

There are twelve different races that you can choose to play in FAangband.  
Each race has its own adjustments to a character's stats and abilities. 
Most races also have intrinsic abilities.  The bonuses to statistics and 
the experience penalty will be displayed next to the races as you move 
to select one.

Hobbits, Beornings and Longbeards make good races for players new to Angband
in general and FAangband in particular.  Druedain, Edain, Grey Elves and
High Elves particularly are only recommended for experienced players.

.. _Easterling:
Easterling:
  Easterlings are the swarthy humans who came into Beleriand late in the
  First Age of Middle-Earth.   All other races are compared to them.
  Easterlings can choose any class and are average at everything.  They 
  have a slight bonus to fighting skill when using swords and 
  crossbows, and have more hit points than many other races.  They get
  a bonus to hit in plains.
 
.. _Green-Elf:
Green Elf:
  Green elves are a branch of the Teleri who abandoned the Great Journey
  of the elves to Aman, but later crossed the Blue Mountains into the
  Land of the Seven Rivers, Ossiriand.  They tend to be smarter and 
  more agile than Easterlings, but are not as strong.  Green elves are 
  better at searching, saving throws, stealth, perception, 
  and shooting (especially with bows), but they are not as good 
  at hand weapons, disarming and magic devices.  Like all elves, Green 
  elves are able to move freely among trees
 
.. _Grey-Elf:
Grey Elf:
  Grey elves are the people of King Thingol, and the first elves to
  settle in Beleriand.  They tend to be wiser and more dexterous than 
  humans and tougher and stronger than green elves.  Grey elves have
  better saving throws but less stealth than green elves, and are better
  at hand-to-hand combat but not as good at shooting.  Grey elves
  resist light effects intrinsically, and like the forest.
 
.. _Hobbit:
Hobbit:
  Hobbits are very good at bows (especially slings), throwing, and have 
  good saving throws.  They are even better at searching, disarming, 
  perception, and stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but prefer to 
  be called burglars.  They will be much weaker than humans, and no 
  good at melee fighting.  They have few hit points, but can sometimes 
  endure ailments that would lay other races low.  Hobbits have fair 
  infravision, so they can detect warm creatures at a distance.  
  Hobbits, like Easterlings, are people of the plains.
 
.. _Petty-Dwarf:
Petty-Dwarf:
  Petty-dwarves are an ancient and diminished race of dwarves thought
  at first by the elves to be orcs.  They were all but wiped out, with
  just one small settlement left in the south of the Ered Luin.
  Petty-dwarves make excellent mages, are the best magical device users 
  of any race, and are good at searching, disarming, and perception.  
  They are reasonably stealthy. They are, however, rather frail and
  are not very good at fighting with hand weapons.  Petty-dwarves have 
  good infra-vision, so they can detect warm-blooded creatures at a 
  distance.  Petty-dwarves are intrinsically protected against 
  paralysis and some slowing effects, and like all dwarves are harder
  to hit when in the mountains, and can move easily through rubble.
 
.. _Dwarf:
Dwarf:
  Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.  They are 
  strong, smart, and tough, but not very wise or agile.  Since 
  dungeons are their natural home, dwarves have very good infravision, 
  can never be blinded, and make good warriors, mages, and necromancers.
  They gain a small bonus to combat skill when using polearms, but 
  don't know the first thing about bows.  Because they are so 
  headstrong, they resist spells which are cast on them.  They do have 
  one big drawback, though:  Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud, singing 
  in loud voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason, screaming 
  out challenges at imagined foes.  In other words, dwarves have a 
  miserable stealth.  They get the same terrain bonuses as 
  Petty-Dwarves.
 
.. _Druadan:
Druadan:
  Druedain, also known as woses, are the woodspeople who live alongside
  the people of Haleth.  They are tough, wise and stealthy, but not very
  street-smart and are poor at devices, disarming and shooting; they
  make excellent druids.  Druedain look, well, funny.  They tend to pay 
  more for goods in town.  Their uncanny appreciation of the natural
  environment gives them the power of telepathy, and they fight more
  skilfully in forest.
 
.. _Longbeard:
Longbeard:
  The longbeards are the eldest of the seven lines of the dwarves.  
  Their home is in Khazad Dum, away from the chief conflicts of 
  Beleriand, but they are always ready for a challenge.  They have all
  the strengths of other dwarves, but their weaknesses are less.

.. _Adan:
Adan:
  The edain are the elf-friends of the houses of Beor, Hador and 
  Haleth.  First of men to enter Beleriand, they surpass the abilities 
  of other humans in every field, are superb melee fighters, and have 
  amazing wisdom and constitution.  They may play any class.  Their 
  constitution cannot be reduced, and like druedain fight their best in
  the forests of Beleriand.
 
.. _High-Elf:
High Elf:
  High elves are the Noldor, who fled from the Undying Lands to try and
  wrest the Silmarils back from Morgoth.  They are masters of all 
  skills, and are agile and intelligent, although their wisdom is 
  sometimes suspect.  High-elves begin their lives able to see the 
  unseen, and resist light effects just like Grey elves.  As other 
  elves, they move freely through trees.
 
.. _Dark-Elf:
Dark Elf:
  Dark elves are those who chose to stay among the stars of Middle-
  Earth rather than see the Light of the Trees in Aman.  They are
  wise and agile, but frail and poor with weapons.  However, dark
  elves are not merely stealthiest of all races, but they never 
  aggravate monsters.  (If they normally would, they suffer a penalty 
  of three to stealth).  The price they pay, though, is an increased
  sensitivity to bright light.  Dark elves have the usual elvish 
  ability to move unhindered through trees.

.. _Ent:
Ent:
  Clad in bark-like skin, and with bodies like the trunks of trees, Ents
  can nevertheless move about perfectly well.  They have poor dungeon 
  survival skills, and are bad at archery and with polearms, but handle 
  other weapons well.  As long as they stay away from fire, Ents will 
  find themselves well capable of surviving many a bitter fight.  As 
  they age, Ents slowly lose the relative suppleness of their sapling 
  youth, trading dexterity for increased strength and constitution.  
  Members of this wise race can never gain feather fall by any means, 
  but will slowly acquire the ability needed to tear rock apart with 
  their weaponless hands.  Since they only need to stand still to be
  mistaken for trees, Ents are incredibly stealthy in forests.
 
.. _Beorning:
Beorning:
  These hardy woodsfolk, though of human origin, have developed a deep
  affinity with nature.  Many of the Beornings have learned the secret
  languanges of animals and some have learned to transform themselves
  into the forms of great bears.  They have respectable survival
  skills and are comfortable with all manner of weapons, but they are
  mediocre with magical devices.  They are at a slight disadvantage in
  charisma and intellegence, but they have better wisdom and 
  consistution than other humans.  When needed, they can take the form
  of an increasingly powerful bear (use the ']' command), making them
  more effective in combat and weaker in magic and archery.  Beorning
  are best known as warriors, rangers, and druids, though they make 
  fine rogues and priests as well.  They fight most skilfully on the 
  plains.


Classes
=======

Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class.  The class 
is the character's occupation and determines stat bonuses, abilities, 
hit dice, and what spells (if any) the character can learn.

.. _Warrior:

Warrior
  A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most problems
  by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of
  a magical device. Their prime stats are strength, constitution, and
  dexterity, and they will strike more blows with melee weapons than any
  other class. A Warrior will be excellent at fighting, shooting and
  throwing, but bad at most other skills. A warrior has bad stealth and
  cannot learn any spells.

.. _Mage:

Mage
  A Mage must live by their wits. They cannot hope to simply hack their way
  through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic to defeat,
  deceive, confuse, and escape. A mage is not really complete without an
  assortment of magical devices to use in addition to his spells. They can
  master the higher level magical devices far easier than anyone else, and
  has the excellent saving throws to resist effects of spells cast at him.
  However, they are incredibly weak, getting few hit dice and suffering strong
  penalties to strength and constitution. Intelligence is their primary stat
  and at high levels they can cast many spells without a chance of failure.
  There is no rule that says a mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells
  are their true realm and they will get fewer blows with melee weapons than
  other classes.

.. _Druid:

Druid
  A Druid is a lover of nature, and at one with the natural world.  Druids
  have control of their environment and direct power over creatures, leading
  even to the ability to take their forms. Druid skills are moderate, and
  they have some fighting ability, especially when transformed.  A druid will
  usually seek to shape the flow of events to their purpose rather than
  using devices or missiles, but at high levels they do gain access to
  potent nature-based magic.  Druids rely on their wisdom, and have good
  saving throws.

.. _Priest:

Priest
  A Priest is a character of holy devotion. They explore the dungeon only
  to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if treasure just happens to
  fall into their packs, well, so much more to the glory of their temple!
  Priests receive their spells from a deity, and therefore do not choose
  which spells they will learn. They are familiar with magical devices,
  preferring to call them "instruments of God", but are not as good as a
  mage in their use. Priests have great saving throws, and make passable
  fighters, better if they can find a blessed weapon.  Wisdom is the priest's
  primary stat and at high enough levels they can cast many prayers without
  a chance of failure. Priests have poor stealth.

.. _Necromancer:

Necromancer
  A Necromancer seeks to master the spirits of sentient creatures, creating
  servants of their own will. They have chosen a dark and wicked path, and
  run a continual risk of harm to their own body and mind. Necromancers love
  shadows and hate light, automatically shrouding themselves in darkness.
  Their spells require high intelligence, and frequently harm the caster or
  place them in danger.  In return they achieve awesome power at high levels.
  The ultimate aim of the necromancer is to supplant the Dark Enemy and set
  up a tyranny in his place.

.. _Paladin:

Paladin
  A Paladin is a warrior/priest. Paladins are very good fighters, second
  only to the warrior class, but not very good at missile weapons. They
  receive prayers at a slower pace than the priest, but can use all but the
  most powerful prayers. A paladin lacks much in the way of abilities.
  Paladins have poor stealth, perception, searching, and magical device use.
  They have a decent saving throw due to their divine alliance. Their
  primary stats are strength and wisdom.

.. _Rogue:

Rogue
  A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by their cunning, but is
  capable of fighting their way out of a tight spot. The master of traps and
  locks, to the experienced rogue no device is impossible to overcome. A rogue
  has a high stealth enabling sneaking around many creatures without
  having to fight, or sneaking up and get the first blow. They can steal items
  from monsters, but need to be wary of being caught in the act. Rogues'
  perception is higher than any other class, and many times they will notice
  a trap or secret door before having to search. A rogue is better than
  the more fighting oriented classes with magical devices, but still cannot
  rely on their performance. Rogues can also learn a few spells, but not the
  powerful offensive spells mages can use, and there will always be a chance
  of failure even with the simplest spells. A rogue's primary stats are
  dexterity and intelligence.

.. _Ranger:

Ranger
  A Ranger is at home in nature, and good at turning the environment to
  good use. Rangers are good fighters, and the best of all the classes with
  missile weapons, especially bows. The ranger learns chiefly spells of
  survival and forest craft. A ranger has good stealth, good perception,
  good searching, a good saving throw, and is good with magical devices.
  Their primary stats are strength, wisdom and dexterity.

.. _Blackguard:

Blackguard
  A Blackguard is a brawler of no principle, who lives for the joy of maiming
  and killing. Blackguards prefer heavy weapons and shields, and learn a few
  spells for the purpose of wreaking more destruction. Their lust for blood
  is legendary, with a blackguard in full cry nigh on impossible to kill.
  Blackguards scorn skills apart from slaughter, and require strength and
  intelligence (or rat-cunning) to thrive in the dungeon.

Stats
=====

After race and class are selected, you will be able to decide what stat
levels your character will have, by allocating a finite number of
"points" between the five statistics.  These points can be allocated 
by selection or with a random roller (as described below in the "Stat 
Rollers" section).  Each race/class combination also has a recommended 
default setting for these statistics.  Statistics can be permanently 
raised by various potions in the dungeon up to 18/100.  They can also be 
temporarily drained by some monster attacks.

.. index::
   single: strength; description
   see: STR; strength

Strength
  Strength is important in fighting with weapons and in melee combat. A
  high strength can improve your chances of hitting as well as the amount
  of damage done with each hit. Characters with low strengths may receive
  penalties. Strength raises the amount of weight you can carry before
  being slowed. It also allows you to get extra blows with heavier weapons.
  Strength is one of the most important stats in the beginning of the game.
 
.. index::
   single: intelligence; description
   see: INT; intelligence

Intelligence
  Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities of spellcasters from the
  arcane and shadow realms: mages, rogues, necromancers and blackguards.
  Intelligence will affect the number of spells you may learn each level as
  well as the number of spell points you receive. Intelligence is the most
  important stat for mages and necromancers. A high intelligence may also
  improve your chances of successfully casting a spell. You cannot learn
  spells if your intelligence is 7 or lower. A good intelligence can also
  help with using magic devices, picking locks, and disarming traps.
 
.. index::
   single: wisdom; description
   see: WIS; wisdom

Wisdom
  The primary function of wisdom is to determine the ability of a priest or
  paladin to use prayers, and druids and rangers to use verses, just like
  intelligence affects spellcasting. Again, high wisdom will increase the
  number of mana points you have and increase the number of prayers or verses
  you can learn each level, while improving your chance of success. A good
  wisdom increases your saving throw, thereby improving your chances of
  resisting magical spells cast upon you by monsters.
 
.. index::
   single: dexterity; description
   see: DEX; dexterity

Dexterity
  Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness. A high dexterity may
  allow a character to get multiple blows with lighter weapons. Dexterity
  also increases a character's chances of hitting with any weapon and of
  dodging blows from enemies. Dexterity is also useful in picking locks,
  disarming traps, protecting yourself from some of the thieves that
  inhabit the dungeons, and (for rogues) stealing successfully from others.
  If the character has a high enough dexterity, thieves will never
  be successful in stealing from them.
 
.. index::
   single: constitution; description
   see: CON; constitution

Constitution
  Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his body, and
  to recover from damage received. Therefore a character with a high
  constitution will receive more hit points and also recover them faster
  while resting. Constitution is less important in the beginning of the
  game, but will be the most important stat at the end.
 
Skills
======

Characters possess some different skills which can help them to survive.  
The starting skill levels of a character are based upon race and class.  
Skill levels may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may increase with 
the level of the character.

.. index::
   single: infravision; description

Infravision
  Infravision is the ability to see heat sources. Since most of the dungeon
  is cool or cold, infravision will not allow the player to see walls and
  objects. Infravision will allow a character to see any warm-blooded
  creatures up to a certain distance. This ability works equally well with
  or without a light source. However, some of FAangband's creatures are
  cold-blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by a light source.
  All non-human races have innate infravision. Humans (including Dunedain)
  cannot gain infravision unless it is magically enhanced. Infravision does
  not increase with character level, and is purely dependent on race and on
  magical equipment.
 
.. index::
   single: fighting skill; description
   see: melee skill; fighting skill
   seealso: to-hit; fighting skill
   seealso: to-dam; fighting skill
   seealso; blows; fighting skill

Fighting
  Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or fists.
  Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon, but with
  high enough dexterity and strength may receive more blows with
  lighter weapons. Strength and dexterity both modify the ability to hit an
  opponent. This skill increases with the level of the character. Inspecting
  a weapon will show you how quickly you can attack with it.
 
.. index::
   single: shooting skill; description

Shooting Ability
  Firing ammunition with a bow, sling, or crossbow is included in this skill.
  Dexterity and this skill affect the chance to hit when firing. It does
  not influence how far ammunition can be fired (that is set by the damage
  multiplier for the bow, sling, or crossbow) or the amount of damage a hit
  causes. This skill increases with the level of the character.
 
.. index::
   single: throwing skill; description

Throwing Skill
  Throwing a weapon or ammunition is included in this skill. Weapons or
  ammunition specially designed for throwing are much better when thrown
  than other weapons or ammunition. Dexterity and this skill affect the chance
  to hit when throwing. It does not influence how far an item can be thrown
  (that is set by strength and the weight of the thrown item) or the amount
  of damage a hit causes. This skill increases with the level of the character.

.. index::
   single: saving throw; description

Saving Throws
  A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the effects of a
  spell cast on him by another person/creature. This does not include
  spells cast on the player by his own stupidity, such as quaffing a nasty
  potion. This ability increases with the level of the character, but then
  most high level creatures are better at casting spells, so it tends to
  even out. A high wisdom also increases this ability. It is possible to
  get 100% saving throw, making you immune to many attacks.
 
.. index::
   single: stealth; description

Stealth
  The ability to move silently about is very useful. Characters with good
  stealth can usually surprise their opponents, gaining the first blow.
  Also, creatures may fail to notice a stealthy character entirely,
  allowing a player to avoid certain fights. This skill is based upon race 
  and class, but can be magically enhanced.
 
.. index::
   single: disarming skill; description
   see: disarm physical; disarming skill
   see: disarm magical; disarming skill

Disarming
  Disarming is the ability to remove traps safely, and also includes
  picking locks on traps and doors. A successful disarming will gain the
  character a small amount of experience. A trap must be found before it
  can be disarmed. Traps are either physical or magical devices, so the
  character has two disarming skills.  Dexterity modifies disarming of
  physical traps, and intelligence modifies disarming of magical traps.
  Both these abilities increase with the level of the character.
 
.. index::
   single: magic devices skill; description

Magical Devices
  Using a magical device such as a wand or staff requires experience and
  knowledge. Spell users such as mages and priests are therefore much
  better at using a magical device than say a warrior. This skill is
  modified by intelligence, and increases with the level of the character.

.. index::
   single: searching skill; description

Searching (Perception)
  Perception is the ability to notice traps without actively seeking them
  out.  Rogues are the best at searching, but rangers are also good at it.
  This skill is based on race and class, and increases with character level.
 
Stat Bonus Tables
=================

Stats, hit dice, infravision and experience point modifications due to 
race and class are listed in the following table.  To get the total hit 
dice, add the "race" and "class" numbers: for instance, a Dwarf Priest
has a hit die of 11+2=13 (i.e. they will get 1d13 hit points per level,
adjusted for constitution).

============   ======= ======= ======= ======= ======= =======  ======= =======

For character classes, there are two figures: the first figure is the base
level of the skill, while the second figure (in parentheses) is the bonus
that the character gains to this skill every ten levels. So, to find out
the total skill value of any character's skills, add the race value to the
class value, and then the bonus once for every ten levels that the
character has. Throwing skill is not shown as its adjustments for race
and class are the same as for the shooting skill except for rogues (72(+45)),
rangers (66(+30)), and blackguards (40(+30)).

Please note, however, that these numbers are only good for comparing
characters to each other in the absence of other bonuses from high stats
(strength bonus to-dam, dex bonus to-hit, wisdom bonus to saving throw,
intelligence bonus to magical device usage, etc.) or wearing magical items.

Specialty Abilities
===================

Specialty abilities are a way of ehancing and customizing characters.  Each
character will gain only a few specialties, so choose the ones that are the
most fun for you and best complement your playing style.

By choosing specialties, you can make your Warrior a melee machine, an archer,
or high-AC  tank.  You can increase the mana and magical abilities of your
spellcasters or improve their normally weak defenses.  Classes with unique
abilites such as the Rogue's monster trap and the Druid's unarmed combat can
choose specialties to further improve these abilities.

Each character can gain a specialty ability at first level, and additional
abilities with each of the first two defeats of quest monsters.  Warriors gain
an additional specialty at level 1.  Use the 'O' command to gain new
specialties or view your current list of race, class, and specialty abilities.

The Specialties
===============

**Armor Mastery** Increase body armor base AC.  Most effective with heavy body
armor.  Available to Warriors, Paladins, and Blackguards.

**Armor Proficiency** Reduced mana penalties for heavy armor.  Allows more armor
to be worn without penalty, and reduces the penalty per pound of additional
armor.  Available to Mages, Necromancers, and Druids.

**Armsman** More critical hits with melee weapons.  Reduces reliance on high
combat skill for criticals.  Available to Warriors, Paladins, Blackguards,
Rogues, Priests, and Rangers.

**Athletics** Increases Dexterity and Constitution and often prevents them from
being reduced.  Available to Warriors, Rogues, Paladins, Blackguards, and
Rangers.

**Beguile** Increases effectiveness of confusion, slow, sleep, fear, and turning
attacks.  Works with spells and devices.  Available to Mages, Necromancers,
and Druids.

**Channeling** Increases the effects of caster-level dependent spells.  The
bonus is strongly dependant on the casters current mana - full mana yields the
maximum bonus.  Available to Mages, Priests, Necromancers, and Druids.

**Clarity** Increases Intellegence and Wisdom and often prevents them from being
reduced.  Available Mages, Priests, Necromancers, and Druids.

**Combat Regeneration** Gain SP when damaged by an enemy or attacking in melee.
Lose SP at half the rate other classes gain them.  Spending SP regains some
health, more when more damaged.  Available only to Blackguards.

**Enhance Magic** Beneficial magics become stronger and last longer.  Includes
all powerups from spells and items (haste, elemental resistance, blessing,
etc).  Available to Mages, Priests, Paladins, Druids, and Necromancers.

**Evasion** Gives a good chance to avoid melee attacks and great chance to avoid
missile weapons such as arrows, darts, and boulders.  The chance depends on
dexterity and armor weight.  Available to Rogues, Warriors, and Rangers.

**Extra Trap** Allows a rogue to have two monster traps at once.  Available
only to Rogues.

**Fast Attacking** Gives a chance of an extra melee strike each round.  The
chance goes up for characters that normally have more attacks.  Effective
armed and unarmed.  Available to Warriors, Paladins, Blackguards, Rogues, and
Rangers.

**Fury** Allows faster action for a short time after attacking in melee or
taking damage.  Available to  Warriors, Priests, Paladins, Blackguards, and
Rangers.

**Harmony** Gain hit points whenever you cast any spell.  Available to
Priests, Paladins, and Druids.

**Heighten Magic** Increases the effects of caster-level dependent spells.
Bonus starts out small but increases as spells are cast in rapid
succession.  Available to Mages, Priests, Necromancers, and Druids.

**Holy Light** Grants increased light radius and resistance to light.  Evil,
undead, and light-sensitive creatures take extra damage in melee and fear
your light-based spells.  Available to Priests and Paladins.

**Magic Resistance** Greatly improved saving throws.  Available to Mages,
Necromancers, and Paladins.

**Mana Burn** Reduces monster mana in melee combat.  The mana burned adds to
the melee damage.  Available to Rogues and Blackguards.

**Marksman** More critical hits with archery and thrown weapons.  Reduces
reliance on high ranged weapon skill for criticals.  Available to Warriors,
Rogues, and Rangers.

**Martial Arts** Gives a powerful unarmed attack (similar to a druid with the
Power Strike specialty).  Available to Warriors, Paladins and Blackguards.

**Meditation** Increased mana regeneration.  Combines well with regeneration
items (such as Defender weapons).  Available to Mages, Priests, Necromancers,
and Druids.

**Mighty Throw** Doubles the range of throwing weapons and other thrown objects.
Available to Blackguards, Rangers, Rogues, and Warriors.

**Phasewalking** Grants a short term speed boost after teleportation.  Give
resistance to all forms of hostile teleportation.  Available to Mages,
Priests, and Rogues.

**Piercing Shot** Archery attacks may skewer multiple targets.  After a
successful hit, an arrow or crossbow bolt will sometimes continue on; targets
behind the original are very like to be hit.  Multiple pierces are possible.
Available to Warriors, Blackguards, and Rangers.

**Power Siphon** Gain mana when monsters in line of sight cast spells.
Available only to Mages.

**Power Strike** Gives an empty handed druid a chance of an unusually strong
attack followed by an attempt to confuse the target.  Available only to Druids.

accuracy.  Available only to Rangers.

items (such as Doriath weapons).  Available to Warriors, Rogues, Paladins,
Rangers, and Druids.

**Shield Mastery** Increased shield base AC, deflection chance, and bashing
damage.  Best with a large shield.  Ineffective when wielding a two-handed
weapon.  Available to Warriors, Blackguards, Paladins, and Rangers (who gain
the ability to shield bash).

**Soul Siphon** Grants mana whenever a living monster is slain.  There is a
chance of taking damage when absorbing too many souls at once.  Available only
to Necromancers.

**Stealing** Ability to steal from monsters using ``s``.  Automatic for Rogues,
available to Necromancers.

**Trap Setting** Grants the ability to set monster traps similar to those set by
all Rogues.  Note that trap damage does depend on disarming skill.  Automatic
for Rogues, available to Warriors, Rangers and Druids.

**Unlight** Increases stealth, provides resist darkness, and gives a vision
radius of 2 when no light is wielded.  In dark areas provides protection from
damage.  Automatic for Necromancers, available to Rogues and Blackguards.

Stat rollers
============

There are currently two different ways to determine the starting stats of
your character - you can choose which one to use from the birth screen.

Point-based
  The point-based method allows you to "buy" improvements to your basic
  stats by "spending" points on them. You have a fixed number of points to
  spend, and making small changes to a stat costs proportionally less than
  making large changes. Any unspent points are converted into your starting
  money that you can use to buy equipment at the start of the game.

  On selecting this option, you will find that the points have already been
  assigned to default recommended values. These represent an algorithm's
  opinion for the ideal point spending. However, you are free to reallocate
  them as you wish.

  This is the recommended birth method.

Standard roller
  The standard roller simply rolls three six-sided dice for each stat,
  leaving everything to chance. You can press ``r`` to re-roll the dice, or
  simply accept what luck has offered.

Character Name
==============

Once you have accepted a character you will asked to provide a name for the
character. In general, the actual choice of a name is not important, but do
keep in mind that it may have some effect on the game itself. For example,
on some machines, the character name determines the filename that will be
used to save the character to disk. The character name is used on the high
score list.

You can play a dynasty of characters. If you use a Roman numeral at the end
of your character name (like "Fred I" or "Pimplesnarg XVI"), the game will
automatically increment the numeral each time you die (or win!).
