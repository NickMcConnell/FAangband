# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,

# Note that several "ego-item" types may share the same "textual name",

# Note that jewellery egos are special; see the comments above the ring and

# Some fields accept randomized numbers of the form "10+2d3M4" where
# 10 is the non-variable base, 2d3 is a standard die roll, and
# M4 uses the m_bonus function to generate a number between 0 and
# 4 according to a normal distribution.  All three components are
# optional, and the number of dice is optional and assumed to be 1
# when not specified.  10+2d3M4 has the range 12-20.  10+M4 has the
# range 10-14.  10+2d3 has the range 12-16.  10+d3 has the range 11-13.
# 2d3, d3, M4, 2d3M4, and d3M4 are all acceptable as well.  Randomized
# expressions which begin with "-" are currently handled differently in
# the "values" line than they are elsewhere.  In the "values" line, the
# leading "-" sets the sign on the base value (i.e. 10 in the example).
# On other lines, a leading "-" in the randomized expression means multiply
# what follows by negative one.  As a result, something like "-d4" will not
# work as you want when used for a "values" line.  Use "-5+1d4" instead.

# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry.

# 'info' is for item information.  Cost is the item's value and rating
# affects level feelings.

# 'alloc' is for allocation details. commonness determines how common
# the object is, min depth is the earliest it is normally found, max
# depth is the deepest it is ever found. The "allocation" depth need
# not match the depth as specified in the "info:" line.

# 'combat' is for combat bonuses - to-hit, to-dam, to-ac.
# Cursed ego-items will negate the given value.  These are
# extra bonuses on top of the normal values, and all of these
# fields accept randomized values.

# 'min-combat' is for minimum values - minimum allowed to-hit, to-dam, to-ac.
# The value of 255 is special, meaning "there is no minimum". This
# allows zero to be a valid minimum (e.g. for mixed-blessing items).

# 'type' is for possible tvals (object bases).  A 'type' line indicates
# that any object kind of that type can be used to generate this ego-item.

# 'item' is for possible tval-sval pairs, which correspond to object kinds.
# One or more 'item' lines are used when we don't want all object kinds of
# this tval to be possible for this ego-item.

# 'act' is for item activation.  Field is the name of the activation (as found
# in activation.txt).

# 'flags' is for flags, which can be either object flags (as found in
# src/list-object-flags.h) or kind flags (src/list-kind-flags.h).  As many
# flags: lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags, and
# flags are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'flags-off' is for flags to remove from the base object. For example, in
# object.txt, lanterns are given TAKES_FUEL. We don't want (Everburning)
# lanterns to take fuel, so we add a 'flags-off:TAKES_FUEL' line to subtract
# that flag.

# 'values' is for properties that take a value.  Valid properties are the
# object modifiers (as found in list-stats.h and list-object-modifiers.h)
# or resistances ('RES_' prepended to the element name from list-elements.h).
# The value appears in brackets after the property name.  For object modifiers,
# the value can be any random expression.  For resistances, it must be a plain
# integer value with the useful ones being 1 (resist), 3 (immune), and -1
# (vulnerable).  Like flags, values are separated by '|' and as many values:
# lines as needed can be used.

# 'min-values' is for minimum values of values recorded in a 'values' line.
# These work like minimum combat values, but for value-defined modifiers.
# While resistances can be specified on a 'values' line, they can not appear
# in a 'min-values' line.  Also, unlike the 'values' line, all the values must
# be plain integers:  full random expressions are not allowed.

# 'act' is any activation that the ego might have - most have none.

# 'brand' adds a brand to the ego.  It should be omitted for egos without
# brands and may appear more than once for egos with multiple brands.  Specify
# the brand to be added by its code in brand.txt.

# 'slay' adds a slay to the ego.  It should be omitted for egos without slays
# and may appear more than once for egos with multiple slays.  Specify the slay
# to be added by its code in slay.txt.

# 'curse' adds curse to the ego.  It should be omitted for egos without curses
# and may appear more than once for egos with multiple curses.  A curse has a
# name (as given in curse.txt) and a power.  The power is a positive integer
# and indicates how hard it is to remove the curse.  A larger power is more
# difficult to remove.

# 'desc' is for description. As many desc: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the object. Note that lines will need spaces at their
# ends or the beginning of the next line to prevent words from running
# together.
