# quest.txt

# This file contains the fixed quests.  The current system is that a 'complete'
# field is marked when the quest is completed.

# This system allows for adding more fixed quests (by adding to this file); it
# also allows for saving and loading of other quests added as a result of game
# events.  Currently there is no game code to add such extra quests.
# The final quest (Morgoth) should be the first fixed quest in this file.

# name:quest name
# type:quest type
# race:monster race
# number:number of monsters
# map:map for place
# place:quest place

# 'name' is a label for the quest

# 'type' indicates the type of quest.  Valid types are 'monster' (kill a number
# of monsters), 'unique' (kill a unique monster), 'place' (visit a place on the
# map) and 'final' (the game-winning quest).

# 'race' is the monster race for monster and unique quests

# 'number' is the number of kills for monster quests

# 'map' - a map entry is needed for any of the world maps which have this quest

# 'place' is the location on the relevant map where the quest takes place;
# 'block' on the end indicates that the way forward from the quest is blocked
# until the quest is complete.

# Every quest requires a name, a type, at least one map, and a single place for
# each map.  There should be only one quest for any place.
