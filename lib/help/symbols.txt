============================= Symbols On Your Map =============================

     Angband and many of its variants allow you to use either ASCII (text) 
characters or graphics to represent the world around you.  Other variants, 
including FAangband, are text-only.  Using text characters has the great advan-
tage of allowing instant on-line identification of any symbol you see.  Type 
'/', then the character.  Also, you may consult the following tables of symbols, 
divided into dungeon features, objects, and monsters:
