===================== Gameplay basics:  The Novice's Guide =====================


NOTE:   In the unlikely event that you are using the roguelike keyset and still
feel the need for a walkthrough, please review the list of commands (in the 
help file "cmdlist.txt"), as all commands mentioned are those of the original 
keyset.

     When you (we shall use the second person from now on) begin the game, you 
start out in a town with stores happy to sell you whatever they stock and you 
can afford.  The town is also populated; stay away from rogues and Battle-
scarred Veterans.  Visit the stores and stop by your very own home (the symbol 
'8'), where you can safely stash all sorts of useful gear for later use.
     You are carrying a few objects, which go in logical places on your person
(your equipment) or in your backpack (your inventory).  Look at your 
'i'nventory by typing 'i', and you will see a few items appropriate to your 
character class.  If you have armor, 'w'ear it, if you have a spellbook, 
'b'rowse it, and 'w'ield any weapons and bows you have.  After you have done
this, look at your 'e'quipment by typing 'e', and check out the places that 
gear can fit into.

     Look at the left side of the screen, where all the most important info
about you is displayed.  Reading from the top, you'll see your race, class,
present title, then your experience level, experience points, and money on
hand.  Your race and class never change, but you can gain more experience
points by killing monsters and more gold by selling the loot they drop.
     Next, the six physical statistics.  You already know that higher is 
better, and you can learn more about them by reading the help file 
"abilattr.txt".  Learn about specialty abilities by reading the help file
"specialt.txt".
     Near the bottom, you will see your armor class, hit points, and (for 
most classes) your spell points.  Armor class shields you from direct damage.  
Hit points are your life wrapped up in a number, so run from anything that 
drops them too low, too fast.  Most classes also have spell points, or 
magical energy that you can put to work by praying or casting spells.

     Get familiar with some of the commands you have available to you, either
by reading the online help file "cmdlist.txt", or by experimenting, whichever 
you prefer.


--- After this... (assumes a little knowledge of commands) ---

     Okay, time to get playing!  Pick up some flasks of oil, or a sling and 
some shots, and either some armor (If you are a warrior.  Store 2, if your 
town has one), some arrows (if you are a ranger.  Store 0, 1 or 3), or some 
phase door scrolls (If you are most other classes.  Stores 4 or 5).  If you 
can afford it, get your hands on a lantern, because the extra light it provides
is very handy at night. Once you've earned a little money, invest in a shovel 
or a pickaxe, and some potions of Cure Light Wounds.  Now, 'w'ear a torch or 
your lantern.  The 'O' command allows you to gain speciality abilities, and to 
view your race, class, and specialty abilities.
     See that path '>'?  It's the way to the world outside your home town (or 
the dungeon if you're playing a dungeon-only game).  Out
there is a wilderness of forests, plains and mountains, swamps and deserts, 
and the deadly, lucrative dungeons.  Head off (Once on the path, type '>').
     Once you do that, you will find yourself in the wilderness.  Unless you 
have spent a long time in town, it will still be daytime, but it is probably
best to keep your light wielded anyway.  If you want some idea of where you're
going, look at the Map of Middle-Earth in this help.
     If you are a warrior, check to make certain everything you can wear is on 
you, and go monster-hunting.  If you are any other class, see if you can learn 
any spells (if "study" is visible on the bottom of your screen, you can).  If 
you can, 'G'ain them, and either 'p'ray or use 'm'agic to use them.  Be very 
careful when experimenting with spells, because you haven't many hit points.  
If you can't learn spells, or find that they aren't doing enough damage, 'v' 
(throw) your flasks of oil and 'f'ire your ammo at monsters (make certain you
have a wielded shooter that fires whatever you have).  When you get hungry, 
'E'at some of the food your character started out with.  And one last note:  
Buy a scroll of Recall.  Find out what it does.

Have fun, and keep your eyes peeled for a Lamp...
