====================== Getting Information From the Game =======================

     This file tells you how to get help about nearly any question you might 
have occasion to ask.  It covers the help system you are navigating, how to 
learn more about yourself, monsters, objects, spells, and the dungeon, and 
offers a little list of useful places on the Web for people with questions about 
Angband, Oangband or FAangband.


=== How to use the In-game Help System ===

You can press Question Mark (?) at any time to leave the online help.

You can press Escape (ESC) to exit the current file, and return to the previous 
help file or menu.  This is handy for navigating.

You can press Space to advance one page, or Return (RET) to advance one line.
If you reach the end of the help file, you will wrap around to the start.

You can press Minus (-) to back up one half page at a time towards the start of 
the help file (this is very inefficient).

You can press Pound (#) [or Percent (%)] to go to a specific line [or file].  
This is very useful for instantly checking out cross-references.

You can press Slash (/) [or Equals (=)] to search for [or highlight] a string
(case sensitive).  Use "#" + "0" + RET + "/" + RET to restart a search.


=== Learning More About Yourself:  The Character Screen ===

     Your character has many attributes that are not shown on the main window. 
Type 'C' to see the character screen, and you will discover:
-how good and how deadly you are with melee weapons and missile launchers,
-your approximate abilities in various special skills, such as disarming,
-yow much exp you need to attain the next experience level, and plenty more.

Once in the character screen, type 'c' to change the name of your character,  
and 'f' to dump your character information to a file in the "lib/user" 
directory.


=== Learning More About Monsters:  Your Monster Memory ===

     There are hundreds of different creatures in the pits of Angband, and it is 
sometimes difficult to remember what various monsters can do to you.  Luckily, 
the game automatically keeps track of your experiences.  Your monster memory 
contains any information you learn about the monster's race, attacks, resis-
tances, and various attributes (like rapid breeding), and can be accessed by 
'l'ooking at (or 'x'amining, in the roguelike keyset) the monster.  
     Even if the creature is no longer around, you may recall this information 
by typing '/', followed by the letter that symbolizes that monster race (such as 
'b' for bat).  If you have questions about other symbols, use the '/' key to ask 
about them too.
     Your monster memory can be passed on to a new character even after you die 
by means of a reduced save file.  You may also recall what uniques your charac-
ter knows about and has killed by using the '~' command.


=== Learning More About Objects:  Object Information ===

     You may 'I'nspect objects to recall what you know about them.  
Depending on how much you've learned, you may merely get information about the 
general kind of object, a basic description of that specific object, artifact 
and special object lore, or even a complete listing of special qualities and 
attributes.  If the object is a weapon or ammunition, you will also get an 
assessment of how much damage can be done with it.  This is very useful to
help you decide which weapon to use.
     If you want to know what artifacts have appeared in the game (and will 
therefore not appear again), or whether you already know about Rings of Speed, 
use the '~' command.


=== Learning More about Spells:  The Browse/Peruse Command ===

All classes may use the 'b'rowse ('P'eruse in the roguelike command set) key 
to thumb through spellbooks or (for warriors) get information about a special 
ability.  If browsing a spellbook, you can get extra information about any 
known spell by typing its letter.


=== Learning More About the Environment:  The "Look" Command ===

     There's so much to see and do in the world that you might get a little 
confused about all the symbols around you.  The 'l'ook (or 'x'amine, in the 
roguelike keyset) command is your friend; simply type that letter, type 'o' if 
you like precise movement control, and use the direction keys to move the cursor 
around.


=== Remembering what you know: The Knowledge Menus

     Pretty much everything you have learned can be revisited by looking at 
the knowledge menus, accessed by '~'.  These menus can also be used to change 
the way objects, monsters and terrain are displayed, and to automatically 
inscribe objects.


=== Places with Useful Information ===
